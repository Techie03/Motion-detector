# Motion-detector
Motion detection with OpenCV and Python In many applications based on machine vision, motion detection is used. For example, when we want to count the people who pass by a certain place or how many cars have passed through a toll. In all these cases, the first thing we have to do is extract the people or vehicles that are at the scene.  There are different techniques, methods, or algorithms that enable motion detection. As in other subjects, there are no generic cases in artificial vision. It will depend on each situation to use one or the other. Let us have a look at some methods used in OpenCV and Computer Vision.
