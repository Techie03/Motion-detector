# Motion-detector
Motion detection with OpenCV and Python In many applications based on machine vision, motion detection is used. For example, when we want to count the people who pass by a certain place or how many cars have passed through a toll. In all these cases, the first thing we have to do is extract the people or vehicles that are at the scene.  There are different techniques, methods, or algorithms that enable motion detection. As in other subjects, there are no generic cases in artificial vision. It will depend on each situation to use one or the other. Let us have a look at some methods used in OpenCV and Computer Vision.

we make use of Motion Detection technology in our daily life. This feature is used in CCTV Cameras to detect any kind of motion in the video frame. In this blog, we are going to make a motion detection script using OpenCV in Python.

Steps For Motion Detection OpenCV Python:-
1) Capturing Real-time video from a camera or Reading recorded video.
2) Read two frames from the video source.
3) Find Out the Difference between the next frame and the previous frame.
4) Apply Image manipulations like Blurring, Thresholding, finding out contours, etc.
5) Finding Area of Contours to detect Motion.
6) Drawing Rectangle on the Motion Detected Areas.
7) Showing the video in the window.
